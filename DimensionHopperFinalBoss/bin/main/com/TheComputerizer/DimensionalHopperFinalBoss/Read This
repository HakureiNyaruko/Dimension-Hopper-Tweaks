Hey all the code is completed such that you can get one with coding
I have done all the code except that of the entity, and I think you should find it super easy.

I would recommend watching these 3 videos so you get an idea of what to do.
I realize that I have already done about the first half of the first one so you dont have to worry about that.
I have also set up the registies, and registered an entity called Final_Boss, this has a seperate class and
I wrote a bunch of stuff there to help you out.  I have also setup everything for textures all you have to do is assign them.
If you get stuck or need any help please let me know.

Also you will notice that there is an error in EntityInit,  that will fall away when you instantiate the entity.
Good Luck
